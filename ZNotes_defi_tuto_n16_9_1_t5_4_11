        // To put your contract into the blockchain
        // The first account is the default for truffle

        > tokenFarm = await TokenFarm.deployed()
            await: promises in javascript
                Not going to run the code immediately, may be the code is long
            AFAIK; we are going to deploy the contract
        > tokenFarm.address
        [output] Address
            Default 
        > name = await tokenFarm.name()
            There is a field "name" in the TokenFarm.sol
        > name
        [output] Address

        Mock Dai Token is going to be placed in TokenFarm
        So you are going to have DappToken for that action

        First, we need TokenFarm_Contract to be aware of Dai_Token

        Depl DAI
        Depl DappToken
        Depl TokenFarm

        You create a new contract, you have to declare it in the migration_files

        We need to insert DappTkn into the TokenFarm
            Bcz, when DaiTkn is inserted into TokenFarm, then the investor should receive DappTkn
        
        Truffle Console
            > mDai = await DaiToken.deployed()
                // Do not forget the "await"
            > accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts()
            > accounts[1]
            > balance = await mDai.balanceOf(accounts[1])
            > balance.toString()
                >>> balance.toString()
            > formattedBalance = web3.utils.fromWei(balance)
                >>> 100
            > web3.utils.toWei('1.5', 'Ether')
                >>> 1500000000000000000
